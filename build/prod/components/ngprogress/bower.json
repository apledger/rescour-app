Prefereble, only for resource heavy sites.\n\n## Usage\n\nDownload ngProgress.js manually or install with bower\n\n```bower install ngprogress```\n\nInclude ngProgress.js ( or ngProgress.min.js) and ngProgress.css in your website.\n\n```<script src=\"app/components/ngProgress/ngProgress.min.js\"></script>```\n```<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"ngProgress.css\">```\n\nInject ngProgress provider in controller\n\n```var MainCtrl = function($scope, $timeout, ngProgress) {\n}```\n\nUse with the API down below\n\n```\nngProgress.start();\n$timeout(ngProgress.complete(), 1000);\n```\n\n## API\n```\n// Starts the animation and adds between 0 - 5 percent to loading\n// each 400 milliseconds. Should always be finished with ngProgress.complete()\n// to hide it\n\nngProgress.start();\n\n// Sets the height of the progressbar. Use any valid CSS value\n// Eg '10px', '1em' or '1%'\n\nngProgress.height();\n\n// Sets the color of the progressbar and it's shadow. Use any valid HTML\n// color\n\nngProgress.color();\n\n// Returns on how many percent the progressbar is at. Should'nt be needed\n\nngProgress.status();\n\n// Stops the progressbar at it's current location\n\nngProgress.stop();\n\n// Set's the progressbar percentage. Use a number between 0 - 100. \n// If 100 is provided, complete will be called.\n\nngProgress.set();\n\n// Resets the progressbar to percetage 0 and therefore will be hided after\n// it's rollbacked\n\nngProgress.reset();\n\n// Jumps to 100% progress and fades away progressbar.\n\nngProgress.complete();\n```\n\n##License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Victor Bjelkholm\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
